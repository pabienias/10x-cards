General project description can be found in @high_level_desc.md
Tech stack can be found in @tech-stack.md
Product Requirements Document is located in @prd.md

Whenever making any changes or suggestion please make sure that they are aligned with above files and they meet the project's requirements.

- Shadcn/ui

## Project structure

Each time you introduce changes to the project please keep in mind the project structure that matches Next.js 16 framework.

- @src/ - here is where all source code is placed
- @src/app/ - here is where Next.js routing-based pages and layouts are located
- @src/components/ - here we should place all static React components that will be reused in pages/layouts
- @src/app/api/ - here is where we will store API endpoint files
- @src/utils/ - here we should store all generic, reusable and stateles utilities, each one in separate directory
- @public/ - public assets

### General guidelines
- New directories should always be named with lowercase using dash case e.g. `components/user-profile`
- Always group code into modules and use `index.ts(x)` entrypoint files to export only those things that are supposed to be used outside
