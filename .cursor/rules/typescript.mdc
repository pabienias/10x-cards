## TypeScript guidelines

### General rules
- All TypeScript files should be named using dash case e.g. `calculate-result.ts`
- Files that export React components should always be named using PascalCase e.g. `UserPicture.tsx`
- Prefer interfaces over types to describe shapes/structures
- Avoid enums - prefer literal types'
- Use named functions using `const` assignments instead `function` declaration
- When creating new TypeScript `.ts` file with only single export, then this filename should be adequate to that export's name
- Never use default exports, always use named exports

### Writing unit tests
- Each source file should have corresponding unit tests file named exactly like source file but with `.test` suffix e.g. source file named `calculate-value.ts` would have `calculate-value.test.ts` unit test file
- Whenever you create a TypeScript `.ts` file, please create a unit test file next to the source file
