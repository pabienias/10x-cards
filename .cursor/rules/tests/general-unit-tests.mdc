### Guidelines for wrtiting unit tests
- Use mocks for all things that are imported (dependencies outside source file)
- Always name the test file exactly the same as source file but with `.test` suffix e.g. `calculate-result.test.ts`
- Always put test file next to source file
- Always keep 1 root level `describe` section
