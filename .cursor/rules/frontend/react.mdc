### General guidelines
- Whenever you add or update React components, please use TypeScript with version pointed in @package.json file
- Always create functional components with hooks, unless it is impossible, but in such a case ask whether we want to proceed with class based component
- Use React.memo() for expensive components that tend to be rendered with same set of properties
- Whenever possible use `useCallback` and `useMemo` hooks to improve performance in client components
- Always use named exports for components, never use default export
- Use Shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for styling React components
- Priortize React Server Components whenever it is possible, use Client components ONLY if they have some user interaction and it is impossible to use Server Component

### Unit tests for React components
- Each React component should have it's own unit test file named `ComponentName.test.tsx` where `ComponentName` should reflect filename of React component's file
- Whenever you create new React component file, please create unit test file and put it next to the source file
